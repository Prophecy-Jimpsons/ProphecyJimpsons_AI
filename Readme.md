ProphecyJimpsons AI Integration 🔮
The Oracle Behind ProphecyJimpsons
ProphecyJimpsons AI is a sophisticated verification system that powers the world's first multi-chain predictive NFT platform. Built on the Aria model architecture, it analyzes and validates predictions across the Solana, Polygon, StarkNet, and Base blockchains.
🤖 Core Features
Prediction Analysis: Advanced natural language processing to validate prophecies
Multi-Chain Verification: Seamless verification across all supported chains
AI Art Generation: Creates unique NFT artwork for each verified prediction
Real-Time Event Matching: Matches predictions with real-world events
Cross-Chain Oracle: Provides verified data across multiple blockchains
🛠 Technical Implementation
python
from prophecy_jimpsons import ProphecyOracle

# Initialize the oracle
oracle = ProphecyOracle(
    model="rhymes-ai/Aria",
    chains=["solana", "polygon", "starknet", "base"]
)
